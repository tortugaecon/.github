Tortuga is Italy’s first think tank made up of young researchers and students from the fields of economics and social sciences. We serve citizens, businesses, and institutions, providing innovative ideas and reliable analysis for a better Italy.

## Our Mission

Tortuga’s mission is to offer a political service to our community and country by promoting and practicing the values that define us. The primary tool for achieving this is through providing in-depth yet accessible analyses and information on the most pressing socio-economic issues.

We also actively contribute to improving public governance by offering professional support to institutions, companies, and policymakers, fostering more efficient and equitable allocation of common resources. Finally, since our foundation, one of our key goals has been to educate our members, shaping them as citizens, professionals, and future policymakers.
